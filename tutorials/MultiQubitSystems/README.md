# Welcome!

This tutorial discusses the representation and properties of multi-qubit systems.

You can run the tutorial online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=tutorials/MultiQubitSystems/MultiQubitSystems.ipynb).
Alternatively, you can install Jupyter and Q# on your machine, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide#develop-with-jupyter-notebooks), and run the tutorial locally by navigating to this folder and starting the notebook from the command line using the following command:

    jupyter notebook MultiQubitSystems.ipynb

The subtleties of applying controlled gates to multi-qubit systems are exemplified here: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77614?#comment-641801 , and in the comments following this thread.
